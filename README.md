Project 2-Third Weel
Group memebers: Josh, Jennifer and Danit

Third Weel is a social application that connects individuals or groups of people to one another. Users can either post or join an event. There are three different categories that a user can choose from: Food & Wine, Sports and Entertainment. The primary demographic is geared towards people who are new to the city.

How it works: Our app provides a way for a group or individual to find local events of similar interest and meet up. To use this app, the user is first directed to the homepage. The Log-in and Sign Up buttons will be at the top that will register the user’s username and password into a database. Once a user signs up, that information will be encrypted into a Jaws Database. Once the user clicks Log-in and types in their information, a modal will pop up saying “You are signed in”. Additionally there are two buttons in the middle of the homepage called, “Join” and “Post”.
POST: When the user clicks on the button, it will direct them to the Post page. On the post page there are forms for the user to fill out that will then be posted. Once the user inputs information into the forms and clicks submit, they will be directed to the join page. If no information is filled in or the user clicks submit before filling in all of the forms, then a modal will pop up prompting the user to finish filling out the information in order for the submit button to continue.
JOIN: The information will be displayed along with a “tag along” button. When the user finds the event that they want, they will click on the tag along button. A modal will pop up saying that the event was saved for that specific user.
